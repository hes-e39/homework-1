Write a function that:
- retrieves the colors from the COLORS endpoint (use [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch]))
- filters the returned colors by:
  - name contains string (case insensitive)
  - hex code (without '#')
  - it contains a complementary color whose name contains a string (case insensitive)
  - it contains a complementary color whose hex code equals a given hex code (without '#')
  
  Examples:
  - give me all the colors that contain 'Blue' in their name
  - give me all the colors with hex code '9FAC58'
  - give me all the colors that have a complementary color whose name contains 'Blue'
  - give me all the colors that have a complementary color whose hex = '9FAC58'
 
```JS
// Example
const result = fetchColors({
  name: 'Almond',
});

// should return 
[{
  "hex": "EFDECD",
  "name": "Almond",
  ...
}];
```
